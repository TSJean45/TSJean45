I always dreamed of being a full-time translator, travelling all around the world and racking my brain to come up with the perfect terminology for the translations I'm working on. All was going well before I ventured beyond my comfort zone and stumbled across the technology industry. Having discovered the endless possibilities of computer programming, it has become a lifelong passion of mine.

I am an aspiring programmer who is currently enrolled as a student at MMU Cyberjaya pursuing a diploma in Information Technology. My passion lies in creating technical solutions for business problems and exploring new ideas as well as learning concepts that I am not familiar with. 

In my diploma studies, Iâ€™ve taken on various leadership roles, including event coordinator and club executive in managing different types of events and club activities. As a full-time student and freelancer in translation, I'm accustomed to being swamped by a variety of academic work and extracurricular activities that require my attention. Yet, this develops my specialities in time management, stress management and multi-tasking. I'm always up for a challenge, no matter how familiar or unfamiliar it may be as I'm always eager to seize any opportunity to learn and grow.

I'm currently seeking a three-month internship from May 2022 to August 2022 in Web Development or Software Engineering division in Kuala Lumpur.
